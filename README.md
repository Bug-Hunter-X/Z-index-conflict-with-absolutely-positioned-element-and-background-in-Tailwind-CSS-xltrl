# Uncommon Tailwind CSS Bug: z-index Conflict

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS related to z-index and layering.  The issue arises when an absolutely positioned element interacts with a background, possibly due to conflicting styles or unexpected behavior with default Tailwind classes.

## Bug Description
The code in `bug.js` creates a simple layout. We use an absolutely positioned element with a higher z-index to place text above a background. However, due to a conflict with default Tailwind styles, this might fail in some setups. 

## Solution
The solution in `bugSolution.js` demonstrates fixes or alternative methods to address this layering problem. This could involve specifying more precise z-index values, using different class combinations, or restructuring the HTML. 

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the Tailwind build process (if necessary).
3. Open the `bug.html` file in your browser. Observe that the text might be covered by the red background.
4. Inspect the `bugSolution.html` for a comparison and to see possible solutions.
